Centralized vs Distributed VCS
	Centralized VCS uses a central location to store all of the source code, data, and records.
	-there are many issues with this...
		-What if we lose internet?
		-What if the remote centralized location goes down?
	Distributed VCS creates a COPY of the source code on each user's machine.	
		- if you losee internet, you can still work on the source code locally.

Common git commands:
	git init: creates a new git repo locally
	git add [FILENAME]: adds file ot staging 
		- git add . : adds all file form the currect directory and the children directories
		- git add -a: adds all changes from any file in the repository to staging 
	git commit -m "message" : adds all changes in staging to the an official commit LOCALLY
	git push: sends latest local commits to remote repository
	git pull: pulls latest commits from remote repo to local repository
	git clone [GITHUB REPO URL]: get remote repo to local machine for the first time
	git log: displays all commits made
	git status: displays what is in staging and more
